# Code Explained

There are 2 ways to run the code.

Both ways have descriptions of the code within the code.

## Kaggle

Click on Copy & Edit to make your version and Run All.

The current state of the code will then go through Dataset Creation, EDA, Feature Selection, Modeling, and Interpretation


## Locally using ipynb file

Our ipynb file and requirements.txt can be found in the SRC folder.

To run our Juypter Notebook you will first need to satisfy package requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

After satisfying the requirements, to demo the code, just Run All.

The current state of the code will then go through Dataset Creation, EDA, Feature Selection, Modeling, and Interpretation
